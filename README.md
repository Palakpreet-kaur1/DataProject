- "Combined Single Limit" means there is one total dollar limit that applies to both bodily injury (BI) and property damage (PD) per accident.
- This is given in format as 250/500, as per my research which means:
    - $250,000 = The maximum the insurer will pay per person for injuries in an accident.
    - $500,000 = The maximum the insurer will pay per accident for all claims combined (bodily injury and property damage together).
